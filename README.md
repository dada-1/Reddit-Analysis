# Reddit-Analysis
In Reddit, posts are organized into user-created boards called "subreddits", which cover a variety of topics like news, science, movies, video games, music, etc.Users can up-vote or down-vote a post, as well as commenting on a post. This project will analyze a sample of posts (withouttheir comments) from a small subset of very active subreddits. The key tasks in this project are:
a.Exploratory data analysis.
b.Automatically classifying posts to their subreddit.
c.Analyzing the sentiments in reddit post titles.
